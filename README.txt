Dhelm is a software tool to programmatically scan different candlestick patterns.

In a stock exchange there are thousands of stocks  enlisted. 
Choosing some of them is obviously a tedious task which require a lot of patience and time.
Technical analysis is an integral part of such stock picking strategies. 
For example lot of traders use candle stick patterns to identify stocks to do trade. 
Some complex mathematical calculations are also used at certain times. 
Traders usually develop some algorithms by selecting some candle stick patterns  to pick a stock. 
When a stock gives a positive signal based on the developed algorithm to go long or short, 
the trader usually takes a position.
 During a time period-it might be minute, hour, day , week or month-many stocks generate a signal based on the 
 devised algorithm. But due to large number of listed securities, 
 it is often impossible to manually identify such stocks in a short period of time. 
 One solution is to programmatically find such stocks. Obviously one computer software which is 
 built on the devised algorithm will make life easy. 
 The basic stage in making such software will be to design such packages which are 
 capable of calculating the different individual candle stick pattern given input data.
 Dhelm v1.0 is a set of such tools which are designed to identify different candle stick patterns
 given the input data as specified . Many automation tools can also be built upon those libraries and apis.
